Problem Description
Three characters { #, *, . } represents a constellation of stars and galaxies in space. Each galaxy is demarcated by # characters. 
There can be one or many stars in a given galaxy. Stars can only be in shape of vowels { A, E, I, O, U } . A collection of * in the shape of the vowels is a star.
A star is contained in a 3x3 block. Stars cannot be overlapping. The dot(.) character denotes empty space.

Given 3xN matrix comprising of { #, *, . } character, find the galaxy and stars within them.

Note: Please pay attention to how vowel A is denoted in a 3x3 block in the examples section below.

Constraints
3 <= N <= 10^5
